data = h5read(filename, dataset)

data = h5read(filename, dataset, start, count, stride, block)

Reads a hyperslab of data from an hdf5 file. The datatype will be coerced
    to double.

  filename: name of the hdf5 file.
  dataset: name of the dataset in the hdf5 file to read.

The other four are 1xn or nx1 matrices, where n is the number of dimensions
    in the dataset. If all are omitted, the entire dataset will be read.

  start: 1-based starting offset
  count: number of blocks to read. If 0 or Inf is specified in any dimension,
         as many blocks as possible are read in that dimension.
  stride: offset between the start of each block. Defaults to a vector of ones.
  block: size of each block to read. Defaults to a vector of ones.
