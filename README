=======================================

This is a library for GNU Octave for reading hdf5 files. At the moment it
provides only few functions:

 h5read: modeled after Matlab's h5read, which can read subsets of a
 	 dataset.  Octave's load function will attempt to read an
 	 entire dataset, which for very large datasets is
 	 undesired. h5util's h5read function does slightly better,
 	 reading only 2d slices of 3d datasets, but that's still
 	 fairly limiting. This exposes libhdf5's H5Sselect_hyperslab
 	 in a way which tries to be compatible with Matlab.

 h5readatt: This function was written by thliebig and allows to read some
 	    HDF5 attributes.

Note that only few of the HDF5 datatypes are supported by hdf5oct.

# INSTALLATION #########################

To install, just use

    make
    
This will produce a package file named "hdf5oct-*.tar.gz" .  Then
you may either install the package with

    make install

or you may start GNU Octave and install the package manually (using
the correct file name) with the command

    pkg install hdf5-0.2.0.tar.gz

This will put the *.oct files somewhere where Octave will find them.
You can try running

    make test


# INSTALLATION #########################

To uninstall the package you may want to use

   make uninstall

# TODO #################################

-allow h5readatt to read strings
-write h5write, h5create, h5writeatt, h5disp, and h5info. This may
 take some fairly major changes to H5File.
-maybe use hdf5's c++ interface instead of the c interace.
-write more comprehensive tests instead of a few random choices. Also test for
 error conditions.
-test with a chunked dataset with an unlimited dimension (should just work,
 though I haven't tried it)
-modify to follow "Octave conventions" if I ever find info on what those are.
